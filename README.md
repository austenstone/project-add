# Add Issue/PR to Project (BETA) âž•

This GitHub [action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) adds issues or pull requests to a [Project (beta)](https://github.com/features/issues).

## Usage
Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/on-issue-pr-open.yml`). See [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

You will need a project number for input `project-number`. For example [`https://github.com/users/austenstone/projects/`*`5`*](https://github.com/users/austenstone/projects/5) the project number is *`5`*.

You will need to [create a PAT(Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=admin:org) that has `admin:org` access so we can read/write to the project.

Add this PAT as a secret so we can use it as input `github-token`, see [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

If your project is part of an organization that has SAML enabled, see [Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

### Organizations

#### Default Workflow for organization owned project
```yml
name: "Add to Project"
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  add_to_project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: austenstone/project-add@main
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}"
          project-number: 1234
```

### Users

For user owned projects you must provide the `user` input in the workflow.

#### Default Workflow for user owned project
```yml
jobs:
  add_to_project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: austenstone/project-add@v4
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}"
          user: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          project-number: 1234
```

## Input Settings
Various inputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml):

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | - | - |
| **project-number** | The project number. Get this from the URL. | N/A |
| github-token | Token to use to authorize. This should be a personal access token. | ${{&nbsp;github.token&nbsp;}} |
| organization | The organization that owns of the project. | _the repository owner_
| user | The user that owns of the project. | N/A

If you are using a user owned project board you must provide the `user` input.<br>`${{ github.repository_owner }}` is fine if you're the owner of the repository.

## Permissions
Until GitHub supports permissions for projects (beta) we will need to [create a PAT(Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=admin:org) with `admin:org` scope.

Once support is added you we can utilize [Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) and the action will default to the token `${{ github.token }}`.

```yml
permissions:
  repository-projects: write
```
