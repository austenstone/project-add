# Add Issue to Project (BETA) âž•

This GitHub [action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) adds issues to the [Projects (beta)](https://github.com/features/issues).

## Usage
Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/on-issue-open.yml`). See [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

You will need a project number. For example [`https://github.com/users/austenstone/projects/`*`5`*](https://github.com/users/austenstone/projects/5) the project number is *`5`*.

You will need to [create a PAT(Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=admin:org) that has `admin:org` access so we can read/write to the project.

Add this PAT as a secret, see [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

If your project is part of an organization that has SAML enabled, see [Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

### Organizations
